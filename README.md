# LedControll
trying to work on getting leds to cycle through nice things because a Raspberry Pi Telss them to..
Endgoal:  Pi polls a Website for current desired state of leds,  
          A script is adjusted if a change is detected on the website,
            Generally the script will just hold 1 value but at certain moments a cycle between LED states (0 - 100) should be possible for the RGB
